Welcome to pymarc's documentation!
==================================

pymarc is a python library for working with bibliographic data encoded in MARC21. It provides an API for reading, writing and modifying MARC records. It was mostly designed to be an emergency eject seat, for getting your data assets out of MARC and into some kind of saner representation. However over the years it has been used to create and modify MARC records, since despite repeated calls for it to die as a format, it seems to be living quite happily as a zombie.
